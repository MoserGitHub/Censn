Implementation of the Stata code to a censored skew-normal approach with delayed entry as described in Moser et al. (2015), Modeling absolute differences in life expectancy with a censored skew-normal regression approach. PeerJ 3:e1162; DOI 10.7717/peerj.1162

Instruction:

Load the https://github.com/MoserGitHub/censn/blob/master/Example.do do-file into Stata 14. It uses the GitHub import function from http://haghish.github.io/github/, which requires Stata 14.

In case of Stata <14 simply copy the files censn.ado, censn.sthlp, and sn_ltrun.ado into an ado-path, set properly the ado-path (adopath + "X:/ado/") and then run the Example.do file.
